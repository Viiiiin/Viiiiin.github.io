#Population
In statistics, a population refers to the total number of statistical units that share at least one common characteristic of interest in a statistical analysis.

For example, a population could be defined as all residents of a particular city who are employed. Since it is usually impractical to gather data from every single individual in the population, a sample is often selected, allowing for the analysis of a subset that represents the larger group.

There are different sampling methods to choose from when selecting a sample. For smaller populations, such as all employees in a specific company, a full population survey could be conducted, which is referred to as a census.

A key principle for all populations is the necessity of clearly defined criteria regarding who is included. For instance, when defining a group like “all employed residents of a city,” one would need to specify whether only full-time employees are included or if part-time and self-employed individuals also count. Similarly, it's important to determine if temporary residents are considered part of the population or only those with permanent residency.


#Statistical units
The basic assumption in statistics is that the analysis is conducted on sets of elements known as "statistical units," and that these units can be described through attributes, which are referred to as "characteristics."

Statistical units can represent any kind of objects or events, whether real or virtual, such as natural phenomena (e.g., rainfall), the outcomes of measurement programs, dice rolls, individuals (such as Italian citizens), groups of people (e.g., households), or social and economic phenomena (like marriages, employment relationships, or bank transactions), among many others.

The "characteristics" of these units will vary depending on what is being analyzed. For individuals, relevant characteristics might include gender, income, or occupation. For "bank transactions," on the other hand, meaningful characteristics could be the type of transaction, the bank involved, the amount of money, the currency, or the maturity date of the transaction.

#Distribution
A statistical distribution, or probability distribution, describes how values are distributed for a field. In other words, the statistical distribution shows which values are common and uncommon.

There are many kinds of statistical distributions, including the bell-shaped normal distribution. We use a statistical distribution to determine how likely a particular value is. For example, if we have a chi-square value, we can use the chi-square distribution to determine how likely this chi-square value is.

#Frequency
### Frequency in Statistics

In statistics, the term "frequency" refers to the number of times a particular event or outcome occurs within a data set. It can be expressed in various forms: absolute, relative, and percentage.

1. **Absolute Frequency**: The absolute frequency, \( f_i \), of a statistical unit is the actual count of occurrences for a given characteristic in the dataset. For example, if 10 out of 100 people surveyed own a car, the absolute frequency of car owners is 10.

2. **Relative Frequency**: The relative frequency, \( f'_i \), is the ratio of the absolute frequency to the total number of observations, \( N \), in the dataset. It is defined by the formula:
   
   \[
   f'_i = \frac{f_i}{N}
   \]
   
   Using the previous example, if 10 out of 100 people own a car, the relative frequency is:
   
   \[
   f'_i = \frac{10}{100} = 0.1
   \]

3. **Percentage Frequency**: The percentage frequency, \( f''_i \), expresses the relative frequency as a percentage. It is calculated by multiplying the relative frequency by 100:

   \[
   f''_i = f'_i \times 100
   \]
   
   For the car ownership example, the percentage frequency is:

   \[
   f''_i = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

In summary, frequency analysis helps in understanding the distribution of characteristics across the dataset, providing insights into how often certain outcomes occur relative to the whole population.
